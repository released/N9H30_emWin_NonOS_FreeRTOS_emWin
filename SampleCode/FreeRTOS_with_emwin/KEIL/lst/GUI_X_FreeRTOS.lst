N * Creates a new queue instance, and returns a handle by which the new queue
N * can be referenced.
N *
N * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, queues use two blocks of
N * memory.  The first block is used to hold the queue's data structures.  The
N * second block is used to hold items placed into the queue.  If a queue is
N * created using xQueueCreate() then both blocks of memory are automatically
N * dynamically allocated inside the xQueueCreate() function.  (see
N * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a queue is created using
N * xQueueCreateStatic() then the application writer must provide the memory that
N * will get used by the queue.  xQueueCreateStatic() therefore allows a queue to
N * be created without using any dynamic memory allocation.
N *
N * http://www.FreeRTOS.org/Embedded-RTOS-Queues.html
N *
N * @param uxQueueLength The maximum number of items that the queue can contain.
N *
N * @param uxItemSize The number of bytes each item in the queue will require.
N * Items are queued by copy, not by reference, so this is the number of bytes
N * that will be copied for each posted item.  Each item on the queue must be
N * the same size.
N *
N * @return If the queue is successfully create then a handle to the newly
N * created queue is returned.  If the queue cannot be created then 0 is
N * returned.

N *

N * Note 2:  Blocking on a queue set that contains a mutex will not cause the

N *
N * Note 3:  An additional 4 bytes of RAM is required for each space in a every

N * total sum of the length of the queues added to the set, where binary

N *  + If a queue set is to hold a counting semaphore that has a maximum count of

N *
N * Creates a new recursive mutex type semaphore instance, and returns a handle
N * by which the new recursive mutex can be referenced.
N *
N * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, recursive mutexs use a block
N * of memory, in which the mutex structure is stored.  If a recursive mutex is
N * created using xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutex() then the required memory is
N * automatically dynamically allocated inside the
N * xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutex() function.  (see
N * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a recursive mutex is created using
N * xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutexStatic() then the application writer must
N * provide the memory that will get used by the mutex.
N * xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutexStatic() therefore allows a recursive mutex to
N * be created without using any dynamic memory allocation.
N *
N * Mutexes created using this macro can be accessed using the
N * xSemaphoreTakeRecursive() and xSemaphoreGiveRecursive() macros.  The

N * semphr. h
N * <pre>SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphoreCreateCounting( UBaseType_t uxMaxCount, UBaseType_t uxInitialCount )</pre>
N *
N * Creates a new counting semaphore instance, and returns a handle by which the
N * new counting semaphore can be referenced.
N *
N * In many usage scenarios it is faster and more memory efficient to use a
N * direct to task notification in place of a counting semaphore!
N * http://www.freertos.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html
N *
N * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, counting semaphores use a
N * block of memory, in which the counting semaphore structure is stored.  If a
N * counting semaphore is created using xSemaphoreCreateCounting() then the
N * required memory is automatically dynamically allocated inside the
N * xSemaphoreCreateCounting() function.  (see
N * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a counting semaphore is created
N * using xSemaphoreCreateCountingStatic() then the application writer can
N * instead optionally provide the memory that will get used by the counting
N * semaphore.  xSemaphoreCreateCountingStatic() therefore allows a counting
N * semaphore to be created without using any dynamic memory allocation.
N *
N * Counting semaphores are typically used for two things:
N *
N * 1) Counting events.
N *
N *    In this usage scenario an event handler will 'give' a semaphore each time
N *    an event occurs (incrementing the semaphore count value), and a handler
N *    task will 'take' a semaphore each time it processes an event
N *    (decrementing the semaphore count value).  The count value is therefore
N *    the difference between the number of events that have occurred and the
N *    number that have been processed.  In this case it is desirable for the
N *    initial count value to be zero.
N *
N * 2) Resource management.
N *
N *    In this usage scenario the count value indicates the number of resources
N *    available.  To obtain control of a resource a task must first obtain a
N *    semaphore - decrementing the semaphore count value.  When the count value
N *    reaches zero there are no free resources.  When a task finishes with the
N *    resource it 'gives' the semaphore back - incrementing the semaphore count
N *    value.  In this case it is desirable for the initial count value to be
N *    equal to the maximum count value, indicating that all resources are free.
N *
N * @param uxMaxCount The maximum count value that can be reached.  When the
N *        semaphore reaches this value it can no longer be 'given'.
N *
N * @param uxInitialCount The count value assigned to the semaphore when it is
N *        created.
N *
N * @return Handle to the created semaphore.  Null if the semaphore could not be
N *         created.
N *
N * Example usage:
N <pre>
N SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore;
N
N void vATask( void * pvParameters )
N {
N SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore = NULL;
N
N    // Semaphore cannot be used before a call to xSemaphoreCreateCounting().

N    xSemaphore = xSemaphoreCreateCounting( 10, 0 );
N
N    if( xSemaphore != NULL )
N    {

N * qualifier can be omitted in order to provide a moderate performance
N * improvement without adversely affecting functional behaviour.  The assembly
N * instructions generated by the IAR, ARM and GCC compilers when the respective
N * compiler's options were set for maximum optimisation has been inspected and
N * deemed to be as intended.  That said, as compiler technology advances, and
N * especially if aggressive cross module optimisation is used (a use case that
N * has not been exercised to any great extend) then it is feasible that the
N * volatile qualifier will be needed for correct optimisation.  It is expected
N * that a compiler removing essential code because, without the volatile
N * qualifier on the list structure members and with aggressive cross module
N * optimisation, the compiler deemed the code unnecessary will result in
N * complete and obvious failure of the scheduler.  If this is ever experienced
N * then the volatile qualifier can be inserted in the relevant places within the
N * list structures by simply defining configLIST_VOLATILE to volatile in
N * FreeRTOSConfig.h (as per the example at the bottom of this comment block).
N * If configLIST_VOLATILE is not defined then the preprocessor directives below
N * will simply #define configLIST_VOLATILE away completely.
N *
N * To use volatile list structure members then add the following line to
N * FreeRTOSConfig.h (without the quotes):
N * "#define configLIST_VOLATILE volatile"

N * second block is used by the task as its stack.  If a task is created using
N * xTaskCreate() then both blocks of memory are automatically dynamically
N * allocated inside the xTaskCreate() function.  (see
N * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a task is created using

N * Create a new task and add it to the list of tasks that are ready to run.
N *
N * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, tasks use two blocks of
N * memory.  The first block is used to hold the task's data structures.  The
N * second block is used by the task as its stack.  If a task is created using
N * xTaskCreate() then both blocks of memory are automatically dynamically
N * allocated inside the xTaskCreate() function.  (see
N * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a task is created using
N * xTaskCreateStatic() then the application writer must provide the required
N * memory.  xTaskCreateStatic() therefore allows a task to be created without
N * using any dynamic memory allocation.
N *
N * @param pvTaskCode Pointer to the task entry function.  Tasks
N * must be implemented to never return (i.e. continuous loop).

N * will be allocated for stack storage.
N *
N * @param pvParameters Pointer that will be used as the parameter for the task
N * being created.
N *
N * @param uxPriority The priority at which the task will run.
N *
N * @param pxStackBuffer Must point to a StackType_t array that has at least
N * ulStackDepth indexes - the array will then be used as the task's stack,
N * removing the need for the stack to be allocated dynamically.
N *
N * @param pxTaskBuffer Must point to a variable of type StaticTask_t, which will
N * then be used to hold the task's data structures, removing the need for the
N * memory to be allocated dynamically.
N *
N * @return If neither pxStackBuffer or pxTaskBuffer are NULL, then the task will

N *
N *
N * vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock relative to

N * period of 100 ticks will cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after
N * vTaskDelay() is called.  vTaskDelay() does not therefore provide a good method
N * of controlling the frequency of a periodic task as the path taken through the

N * next executes.  See vTaskDelayUntil() for an alternative API function designed

N *
N * This function differs from vTaskDelay () in one important aspect:  vTaskDelay () will

N * calling vTaskDelay () may not be fixed [the task may take a different path though the
N * code between calls, or may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
N * each time it executes].
N *
N * Whereas vTaskDelay () specifies a wake time relative to the time at which the function
N * is called, vTaskDelayUntil () specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
